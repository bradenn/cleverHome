###open source home automation

This cluster of jumbled code is not anything to be aroused by... This is just a fun project I'm working on for home automation.

##What was used:
- PHP
- HTML
- CSS
- MONGODB
- PYTHON
- and some stuff I cant remeber probably.

##Requirements for use:
- Mind ready capabilities (to figure out how to use the code)
- Webserver
- Mongodb
- PHP/Python / the works
- Mongodb PHP Lib via composer (vendor/autoload.php)
- 'config.php' in the root directory
- $cleverHomeSecurityCode with a 4 digit value in 'config.php'
- $cleveHomeMongoAddress with mongo connect address in 'config.php'

######IM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU MESSING UP STUFF ON YOUR SERVER
######THIS CODE IS WILDY INEFFICIENT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED PROFESSIONALLY
